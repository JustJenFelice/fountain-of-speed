The Fountain of Speed -  Simple, Often-Overlooked Tricks to Optimize your HTML and CSS
============

This is my presentation for the 2013 NIC Technology Conference. It's based on the Impress.js presentation framework (https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) by Bartek Szopka.

It's not exactly a hallmark of best practices (which is pretty ironic, considering my presentation subject), but I wanted to incorporate some of the more advanced functionality of the framework into my presentation. And, honestly, I reserve my right to be a paradox of contradiction, so just roll with it :)
